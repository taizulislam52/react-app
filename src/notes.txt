## props vs state

1
  -- props are input passed to a component similar to function arguments
  -- state is data managent by a component treat like a local variable

2
  -- props are immutable (readonly)
  -- state is mutable

If React detech any change on props and state change react will re-render the components and update the dom accordingly
